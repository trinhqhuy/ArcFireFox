## Introduction

This project provides a custom userChrome.css file for Firefox that modifies the user interface to resemble the Arc browser. The Arc browser is known for its sleek, modern design, and this theme aims to bring that aesthetic to Firefox users.

## Installation

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter. You'll see a warning, click on `I accept the risk!`.

2. In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`, double-click on the result to change its value to `true`.

3. Go to your Firefox profile directory (`about:support` -> `Profile Folder` -> `Open Folder`).

4. Create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't exist.

5. Download the `userChrome.css` file from this repository and place it in the `chrome` folder.

6. Restart Firefox.

Please note that the changes will only take effect after restarting Firefox.

## Features

- Sleek, modern design inspired by the Arc browser.
